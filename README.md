Writing functional programming is a very powerful programing paradigm that I really like and trying to get better at for every day. I think it is a relly big trend now a days. Many people see the benefits of writing functional programs.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Functional programming is about:

1) Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

2) Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

3) Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

``` 
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

``` sh
  git clone <Project url>
  cd into <Project>

```

And Have fun!
Nothing to install!

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

``` bash
  yarn test
  # or
  yarn test --watch
```

<!-- ### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

``` 
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
